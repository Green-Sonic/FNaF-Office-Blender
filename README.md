# FNaF-Office-Blender

Hello there everyone. This project is about an office I made in blender that was based off the office in the first Five Nights At Freddy's game.
I created the render during a 3D modeling course I took at DigiPen.
The actual model and elements of the office are quite basic, but what really pulls it together is the ambient lighting.
Hope you all like what you see.
